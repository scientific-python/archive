## Scientific Python - By maintainers and for maintainers



## Short Summary

The future of Scientific Python is here. Behind the scene, major scientific projects have been contributing together to craft a joint community. Learn its goal, what are the prospects and most importantly: how to be part of the advanture.


## Abstract

The Scientific Python organisation's vision is to help paves the way for a greater and stronger scientific Python community. There are two axis the organization is focusing on to help make it happen: _(i)_ create a community around all scientific projects; _(ii)_ support maintainers on technical aspects. This talk will focus on the second aspect and present current and future initiatives.

The organization has already designed some reference guidelines for projects to adopt: called SPEC or Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination. SPECs are similar to projects specific guidelines like PIP, NEP, SLEP, to name a few. With the distinction that SPECs are general and target all projects from the scientific community.

We also provide a set of tools to help maintainers. This includes a theme for the organizational website of the projects, a self-hosted solution to have web metrics and community statistics, a forum and a technical blog.

All these tools and SPECs will be presented and will highlight the potential of this organization.

The talk will close on a general call of action. The Scientific Python organisation is already being supported of 8 core projects: IPython, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn and SciPy. The organization has spent the last months working on the infrastructure and is now ready to be rolled out and actively help the community.
