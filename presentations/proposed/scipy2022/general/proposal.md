## Title

Scientific Python---From GitHub to TikTok

## Short Summary

The Scientific Python project aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community.
This talk focuses on our efforts to expand our community by generating a welcoming and friendly
environment where people collaborate, build, and improve together.
Come hear about our recent community building and outreach efforts, and
learn how you can get involved!

## Abstract

As developers, we sometimes focus too much on writing code and too little on community.
However, open source is about more than that.
It is about communicating, teaching, and collaborating.
The Scientific Python project’s goal is to unify the community by promoting integration, diversity, and wide participation,
while generating resources that help bring contributors, developers, and users together. 

### Documentation

Documentation is a key aspect of every Python software project.
Thus, we want to have a central landing place for information that will help users and contributors better understand the ecosystem.
The scientific-python.org website contains resources that we hope will be used and adopted by many of the projects.
These include videos that orient newcomers to the ecosystem, interviews that introduce some of the members of our community and
how they contribute, and demos, which give an overview of the problem solving workflow in the Scientific Python ecosystem. 

### Blog 

The Scientific Python blog is a place where contributors can share their thoughts and ideas in order to learn more about the ecosystem together.
We strongly believe that healthy communities are built when everyone’s voice is heard and different perspectives are valued.

### Social Media

Outreach and engagement are also important ways of growing our community.
Nowadays, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are a big part of people's lives.
In order to stay connected, we will use social media to share our content and interact directly with users and developers.
This will help us stay in touch with more people that are interested in contributing.

### Come join us!

This talk shares our view of the future of the Scientific Python community and is a call to action for others to join us in this journey.
We are looking for people with varying skills, backgrounds, and perspectives to build an inclusive, diverse, and friendly ecosystem.
