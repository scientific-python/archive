# PyCon 2022 Proposal

April 24th--29th, 2022

https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/maintainers-summit/

## Title

Scientific Python: Past, Future, and Present

## Topic summary

The Scientific Python ecosystem is a loose federation of libraries written by
volunteers for use by themselves and the community. It is now the de facto
platform for scientific research and data science. In this talk I discuss how a
small, unfunded, community effort managed to succeed against the odds; the
challenges it faces; what can be done (by us, by you!) to make it better; and
what lies on the road ahead.

## Key takeaways (why/how it benefits the Maintainers Summit audience)

Learn how the Scientific Python project is working to better coordinate this loose federation of libraries
and grow the community of contributors.

## Outline of your talk

- brief history of how the scientific Python ecosystem came to be
- describe new effort to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community
- explain what we are doing and what comes next

## Abstract (max 300 words in length)

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way towards a
unified, expanded scientific Python community. It focuses its efforts along two
primary axes: (i) to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and (ii) to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical
infrastructure and tools.

The project has already launched a process whereby projects can, voluntarily,
adopt reference guidelines; these are known as SPECs or Scientific Python
Ecosystem Coordination documents. SPECs are similar to projects specific
guidelines like PEPs, NEPs, SLEPs, and SKIPs, to name a few. The distinction
being that SPECs have a broader scope, targeted at all (or most) projects from
the scientific Python ecosystem.

The project also provides and maintains tools to help maintainers. This
includes a theme for the project websites (currently used on, e.g., numpy.org
and scipy.org), a self-hosted privacy-friendly web analytics platform, a
community discussions forum, a technical blog, and project development
statistics.

We present all these tools, discuss various upcoming SPECs, and highlight the
project's future potential.

## Speaker intro (max 150 words in length)

Jarrod Millman is a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley. He received a BA from Cornell
University in 1998. After working at the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis,
he came to UC Berkeley in 2000â€”first to design the data analysis system for the
Brain Imaging Center and then as the director of research computing for the
Neuroscience Institute. At Berkeley, Jarrod cofounded the Neuroimaging in
Python project. He was the NumPy and SciPy release manager from 2007 to 2009.
He cofounded NumFOCUS and served on its board from 2011 to 2015. Currently, he
is the release manager of NetworkX and a community leader of the Scientific
Python project.
