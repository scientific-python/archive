    \vfill\noindent

    We ask that the eScience Institute at the University of Washington sponsor the first annual Scientific Python Developer Summit by providing workspaces for up to forty participants, who will develop shared infrastructure for libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem. The week-long summit will take place sometime between February and June 2023.

# Goals

The Scientific Python Developer Summit provides an opportunity for core developers
from the scientific Python ecosystem to come together to:

## 1. Improve joint infrastructure

Collaborate to adopt and improve infrastructure, tools, and processes
used across projects. This includes infrastructure already described
in Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents (SPECs), as well
as, but not limited to, tools for documentation, testing, benchmarking,
packaging, and Continuous Integration (CI).

## 2. Better coordinate core projects

A central goal of the Scientific Python project and, by implication, the summit, is to better coordinate maintenance of the different projects.
We want to write up a maintenance manual with community best practices, agree on a common release schedule, establish channels for regular cross-project communication, and decide on joint governance structures.

## 3. Work on a shared strategic plan

The strategic plan will identify core needs and future challenges of the scientific Python community.
Rather than focusing on the technical details of one particular project or domain area, the strategic plan would discuss the challenges shared across projects and domains.
The plan will also be used by the community for support when applying for federal grants.

# Logistics

We have funding to cover 40 participants for five days and six nights including travel, food, and lodging.
This will be an invite-only event that requires upfront agreement to commit a substantial amount of time to
(a) take part in three to four months of pre-summit planning,
(b) attend the one-week summit in-person, and
(c) participate in several months of post-summit implementation.

## Participants

Participants will be recruited from the community of developers already actively engaged with the Scientific Python project.
Developers will represent packages such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, xarray, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, NetworkX, and IPython, as well as domain stacks including Astropy, Pangeo, and scikit-HEP.

## Timing

We need four months lead time to plan and coordinate work.
Assuming we get an early confirmation, a one-week period between February and June 2023 would be ideal for the summit itself. Spring or early summer break would be ideal.

## Pre-Summit Planning

Participants will be responsible for attending two or more one-hour video meetings and for
participating in a planning repository via PRs, issues—as both contributors and reviewers.
The work plan will be decided before the meeting, and includes deciding on topics, dividing the work, and scheduling the meeting.

## Summit Execution

We do not need the entire group to meet in one room at the same time, because work will be planned and subdivided beforehand.
Lunch could be catered and delivered to the work rooms, or we could go to nearby restaurants.

## Post-Summit Implementation

After the meeting, attendees will collaborate on their assigned tasks until completion.
The Scientific Python project also has funding to further develop some of these tasks, and will apply for additional funds to complete some of the rest.
